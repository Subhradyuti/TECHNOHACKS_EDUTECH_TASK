# Employee Turnover Prediction

## Introduction
This project aims to predict employee turnover using machine learning techniques. Employee turnover, or attrition, is a crucial concern for organizations, and predicting which employees are likely to leave can help in implementing retention strategies.

## Problem Statement
The problem statement involves building a model that can predict which employees are most likely to leave the company based on various features such as age, job role, department, satisfaction levels, etc.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the [WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv](link/to/dataset) dataset, containing information about employees such as age, job role, department, satisfaction levels, and whether they have left the company or not.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: This involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into train and test sets.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the data through visualizations and statistical summaries.
3. **Model Building**:
    - **Logistic Regression**: A baseline model for binary classification.
    - **Random Forest Classifier**: A more complex model to capture non-linear relationships.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing the Random Forest model using GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters.

## Results
- Logistic Regression achieved an accuracy of approximately 89%.
- Random Forest Classifier achieved an accuracy of around 87%.
- Hyperparameter tuning improved the Random Forest model's performance, achieving a cross-validation score of about 85.5%.

## Conclusion
The predictive models developed in this project can assist organizations in identifying employees at risk of turnover, allowing them to implement proactive measures for employee retention.

## Future Work
- Explore other machine learning algorithms such as Gradient Boosting Machines or Neural Networks.
- Gather more features or data sources to enhance the predictive power of the models.
- Implement the models into a production environment for real-time predictions.


# House Price Prediction

## Introduction
This project aims to predict house prices using machine learning techniques. It utilizes a dataset containing information about housing prices and features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.

## Problem Statement
The goal is to train a model that can accurately predict the price of a new house based on its features.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is `kc_house_data.csv`, which includes various features such as id, date, price, bedrooms, bathrooms, sqft_living, sqft_lot, floors, waterfront, view, condition, grade, sqft_above, sqft_basement, yr_built, yr_renovated, zipcode, lat, long, sqft_living15, and sqft_lot15.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Importing necessary libraries, reading the dataset, and exploring the data using descriptive statistics.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the data to understand relationships between features and the target variable.
3. **Model Building**:
   - Linear Regression: A baseline model for predicting house prices.
   - Gradient Boosting Regressor: A more complex model for improved prediction performance.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the models using performance metrics such as R-squared score.
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing the Gradient Boosting Regressor model using hyperparameters.
6. **Visualization**: Visualizing the performance of the models and training progress.

## Results
- The Gradient Boosting Regressor model achieved an R-squared score of approximately 0.898, indicating a good fit to the data.
- Hyperparameter tuning further improved the model's performance.

## Conclusion
The predictive models developed in this project can assist in estimating house prices accurately based on various features, providing valuable insights for real estate stakeholders.

## Future Work
- Explore other regression algorithms such as Random Forest Regressor or Support Vector Regression.
- Gather additional features or data sources to enhance the predictive power of the models.
- Implement the models into a production environment for real-time predictions.
