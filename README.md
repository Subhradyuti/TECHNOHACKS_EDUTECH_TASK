# Employee Turnover Prediction

## Introduction
This project aims to predict employee turnover using machine learning techniques. Employee turnover, or attrition, is a crucial concern for organizations, and predicting which employees are likely to leave can help in implementing retention strategies.

## Problem Statement
The problem statement involves building a model that can predict which employees are most likely to leave the company based on various features such as age, job role, department, satisfaction levels, etc.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the [WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv](link/to/dataset) dataset, containing information about employees such as age, job role, department, satisfaction levels, and whether they have left the company or not.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: This involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into train and test sets.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the data through visualizations and statistical summaries.
3. **Model Building**:
    - **Logistic Regression**: A baseline model for binary classification.
    - **Random Forest Classifier**: A more complex model to capture non-linear relationships.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing the Random Forest model using GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters.

## Results
- Logistic Regression achieved an accuracy of approximately 89%.
- Random Forest Classifier achieved an accuracy of around 87%.
- Hyperparameter tuning improved the Random Forest model's performance, achieving a cross-validation score of about 85.5%.

## Conclusion
The predictive models developed in this project can assist organizations in identifying employees at risk of turnover, allowing them to implement proactive measures for employee retention.

## Future Work
- Explore other machine learning algorithms such as Gradient Boosting Machines or Neural Networks.
- Gather more features or data sources to enhance the predictive power of the models.
- Implement the models into a production environment for real-time predictions.


# House Price Prediction

## Introduction
This project aims to predict house prices using machine learning techniques. It utilizes a dataset containing information about housing prices and features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.

## Problem Statement
The goal is to train a model that can accurately predict the price of a new house based on its features.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is `kc_house_data.csv`, which includes various features such as id, date, price, bedrooms, bathrooms, sqft_living, sqft_lot, floors, waterfront, view, condition, grade, sqft_above, sqft_basement, yr_built, yr_renovated, zipcode, lat, long, sqft_living15, and sqft_lot15.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Importing necessary libraries, reading the dataset, and exploring the data using descriptive statistics.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the data to understand relationships between features and the target variable.
3. **Model Building**:
   - Linear Regression: A baseline model for predicting house prices.
   - Gradient Boosting Regressor: A more complex model for improved prediction performance.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the models using performance metrics such as R-squared score.
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing the Gradient Boosting Regressor model using hyperparameters.
6. **Visualization**: Visualizing the performance of the models and training progress.

## Results
- The Gradient Boosting Regressor model achieved an R-squared score of approximately 0.898, indicating a good fit to the data.
- Hyperparameter tuning further improved the model's performance.

## Conclusion
The predictive models developed in this project can assist in estimating house prices accurately based on various features, providing valuable insights for real estate stakeholders.

## Future Work
- Explore other regression algorithms such as Random Forest Regressor or Support Vector Regression.
- Gather additional features or data sources to enhance the predictive power of the models.
- Implement the models into a production environment for real-time predictions.

## Introduction
This project performs sentiment analysis on a dataset of tweets to classify them as positive, negative, or neutral. The analysis includes preprocessing of the text data, sentiment classification, and visualization of the results. Additionally, aspect-based sentiment analysis is conducted to identify specific aspects associated with positive and negative sentiments.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of tweets related to various airlines. Each tweet includes information such as tweet text, sentiment, and reasons for negative sentiments.

## Libraries Used
- pandas
- nltk
- re
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- wordcloud

## Preprocessing
1. Remove noise and irrelevant information (URLs, mentions, hashtags).
2. Convert text to lowercase.
3. Tokenize the text into individual words.
4. Remove stopwords.
5. Lemmatize the words to their base form.

## Sentiment Classification
- The `SentimentIntensityAnalyzer` from NLTK is used to compute sentiment scores for each tweet.
- Tweets are classified as positive, negative, or neutral based on the sentiment score.

## Visualization
- Bar chart and pie chart visualizations show the distribution and proportions of different sentiment categories.
- A word cloud visualizes the most common words in negative tweets.

## Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis
- Specific aspects (service, price, quality, delivery) are identified in the tweets.
- Sentiment analysis is performed for each identified aspect to determine the number of positive and negative mentions.

## Reasons for Negative Tweets
- The reasons for negative tweets are counted and visualized in a bar chart.

## Word Cloud of Negative Sentiments
- A word cloud is generated to visualize the most common words in negative tweets after removing stopwords and irrelevant text.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the required libraries. You can install the libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas nltk matplotlib seaborn wordcloud
## Usage
